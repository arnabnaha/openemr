/////////////////////////////////
Helpful information to customize with OEMR:
1) place main folder (image_draw) into interface/forms/ 
2) Login as admin and install in the forms section
3) you can place any image in the bgimages folder and it will show up on the drawing application as a selection option, however you should make the file size 475 x 375 for best resolution and it will also keep the file size small when saved.
4) images are stored in the "images" folder and given a unique id
5) in the param value in the new.php, you may need to specify the full path to the draw1.swf file
6) saved images are not deleted when users clicks delete, but are changed to 1 = "deleted" in the db in forms and image_draw and are removed from view.
